# Conclusion

Through this project, we have explored several key questions leading to insights into post-secondary employment outcomes. STEM fields and advanced degrees generally offer the highest earning potential and growth over time, though there are exceptions, particularly in professional degrees. Healthcare and business degrees remain consistently popular and lucrative, while technology fields stand out for their strong growth potential. State-level disparities in earnings highlight the impact of local job markets and industry presence on post-graduation income. For certain fields, the awarding institution plays a significant role in shaping outcomes, highlighting the importance of education quality and institutional reputation, especially in higher income and more popular fields. Furthermore, degree level does seem to have a significant impact on earnings and growth potential, making a Masters worth it. Lastly, certain degrees have seen significant changes in earnings outcomes over the past two decades, highlighting the importance of keeping up with the current trends in the job market when making decisions about your education and career.

However, these findings are shaped by the limitations of the dataset. Incomplete state-level coverage and missing Year 5 and Year 10 data for more recent cohorts restrict the scope of time-based analyses. Additionally, our analysis simplifies a complex decision-making process - choosing a degree, major, or institution - by focusing on income and employment metrics, while numerous factors specific to an individual remain unaccounted for. Despite these constraints, through aggregation by field and degree level, we ensure that our insights can still provide a valuable baseline for prospective students, helping them make more informed decisions about their education.

Future work could build on this foundation by incorporating demographic data to examine outcomes by socioeconomic status, gender, and race. This would offer a more nuanced understanding of the observed disparities. Also, leveraging additional datasets from additional authoritative and governmental sources could enhance the robustness of the analysis, while expanding employment metrics to include less quantifiable values like employee satisfaction and fulfillment could further refine the guidance for students. Overall, this project has demonstrated the importance of nuanced data interpretation for clear and helpful insights for students, all while navigating the challenges of incomplete data.
