# Introduction
Choosing a college, deciding on a major, and pursuing graduate studies are pivotal decisions that significantly shape an individualâ€™s career trajectory and financial future. These choices determine career opportunities and influence long-term earnings potential and overall personal fulfillment. While personal interests and intellectual growth are equally valid reasons for pursuing higher education, this project focuses on understanding how these decisions translate into measurable post-graduation outcomes, specifically earnings and employment rates.

With over 60% of Americans having attended college and enrollment numbers increasing annually, the relevance of exploring post-secondary employment outcomes continues to grow (Census, NCES). Analyzing this data provides valuable insights that can help prospective students evaluate fields of study and degree levels in alignment with their career aspirations and financial goals. This analysis aims to support informed decision-making for students and families by focusing on the measurable outcomes available to us through data.

For the reasons above, we have focused on this Post-Secondary Employment Outcomes topic. This project will explore the following general questions:

- What are the top-earning fields of study within each degree type and across time?
- How do earnings compare across states?
- Is there a correlation between Year 1 income outcomes and employment counts by degree level?
- How does the total number of graduates compare to employed graduates by degree level?
- How do employment outcomes compare across the most popular fields?
- What is the growth potential for different degree levels?
- Is a Masters worth it?
- How important is the institution where you earned your degree?
- How have career prospects changed over time?
- What are the most popular fields of study over time?
