    "text": "1 Introduction\nChoosing a college, deciding on a major, and pursuing graduate studies are pivotal decisions that significantly shape an individual’s career trajectory and financial future. These choices determine career opportunities and influence long-term earnings potential and overall personal fulfillment. While personal interests and intellectual growth are equally valid reasons for pursuing higher education, this project focuses on understanding how these decisions translate into measurable post-graduation outcomes, specifically earnings and employment rates.\nWith over 60% of Americans having attended college and enrollment numbers increasing annually, the relevance of exploring post-secondary employment outcomes continues to grow (Census, NCES). Analyzing this data provides valuable insights that can help prospective students evaluate fields of study and degree levels in alignment with their career aspirations and financial goals. This analysis aims to support informed decision-making for students and families by focusing on the measurable outcomes available to us through data.\nFor the reasons above, we have focused on this Post-Secondary Employment Outcomes topic. This project will explore the following general questions:\n\nWhat are the top-earning fields of study within each degree type and across time?\nHow do earnings compare across states?\nIs there a correlation between Year 1 income outcomes and employment counts by degree level?\nHow does the total number of graduates compare to employed graduates by degree level?\nHow do employment outcomes compare across the most popular fields?\nWhat is the growth potential for different degree levels?\nIs a Masters worth it?\nHow important is the institution where you earned your degree?\nHow have career prospects changed over time?\nWhat are the most popular fields of study over time?\n\n\n1.0.1 References\n\nCensus Bureau, Educational Attainment\nNational Center for Education Statistics, Educational Attainment (NCES)",

    "text": "2.1.1 Data Source\nThe national and state-level PSEO datasets are publicly available through the United States Center for Economic Studies. Specifically, we are using the PSEOE files (contains salary and employment statistics) from the PSEO section. We are also using official PSEOE schema files with ID to string value mappings.\n\n\n2.1.2 Data Collection\nThe data is collected through the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program. This program partners with various post-secondary institutions, state agencies, and the United States Census Bureau. LEHD merges administrative job data with the post-secondary education records from its partners to create the PSEO datasets.\n\n\n2.1.3 Data Format\nWe are working with CSV files downloaded directly from the public data access page. The national-level datasets contains approximately 564,000 records and 36 columns, covering aggregated earnings and employment outcomes for graduates 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years post-graduation (when available).\nNote that there are three types of columns in the PSEO datasets:\n\nID: unique identifiers for each group\nData: provides earning and employment information about the given group.\n\nAll outcomes are recorded 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years post-graduation when applicable\nEarning outcomes are provided through the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, in 2021 dollars\n\nStatus: provides information about the “quality” of an observation in its respective data column\n\nThe main identifiers in the dataset and their respective mapping ID to string mapping files that we will use in our analysis includes:\n\nInstitution\nDegree Level\nDegree Field\nCohort Graduation Year\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Data Coverage\nThe data covers the years from 2001 to 2016 as of the 2023Q20 release. New data for additional partner institutions is added irregularly, such as the June 2024 update that incorporated new universities. See the PSEO data notices for their updates.\nLimitations: There are regional coverage gaps in the dataset because it only includes outcomes from institutions that have partnered with the Census Bureau through data-sharing agreements. For that reason, many states have no coverage while most others only have partial coverage. Breakdown of state-by-state coverage can be found on this webpage.\nTherefore, the provided dataset is only a sample of all graduating students, so we have to be aware that there might be an implicit bias in the dataset. This means that some results obtained in this analysis might not apply when considering the whole population of graduating students. However, as there is still enough data for most degrees and cohorts, and we try to control for this bias where possible, our analysis can still act as a baseline for students for educational and career guidance.\n\n\n2.1.5 Data References/Documentation\nFor more details on the above, see the follow resources:\n\nPSEO Data (Data Download & Coverage Stats)\nPSEO Documentation (High Level Summary)\nPSEO Technical Documentation (Technical Details, Data Collection, Rationale)\nPSEO Schema (4.25, 4.36, 5.13.2, 5.14, 5.15.2, 5.16)\nPSEO Data Notices\n\n\n\n2.1.6 Data Preprocessing\nWe modify the raw data for the sake of cleaner visualization and analysis by doing the following:\n\nMapping Institution, Degree Level, and Degree Field to string values from integer IDs\nFilter out rows that contain pre-aggregated values, i.e., rows that correspond to all institutions in a particular state or all individuals across all graduate cohorts\n\nWe calculate aggregated values as needed ourselves\n\nTruncate Degree Field labels to fit in visualizations.",

The year 5 earnings columns are missing about 60 percent of the time, and the year 1 earnings columns about 50%. When looking at the missing patterns, we also see that the earnings columns for a given year are always missing together, i.e. if one percentile is missing the others are also missing. Furthermore, the columns ending with “_emp”, indicating the amount of employed graduates for the given year, is also always missing together with the corresponding earnings columns. Lastly, the columns ending in “_tot”, indicating the total amount of graduates for which the earnings percentiles are calculated for the given group and year, are always missing less often than the corresponding earnings columns.\nThe next thing that we can take into account is that the dataset gives us information about the data present in the data columns through the status columns. Concretely, the status columns contain one of the values shown in the following table (from the LEHD data schema):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatus code\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n-2\nNo data available in this category for this quarter\n\n\n-1\nData not available to compute this estimate\n\n\n1\nOK\n\n\n2\nIPEDS counts edited for consistency with PSEO categories\n\n\n3\nIPEDS counts not available\n\n\n4\nIPEDS counts partially missing\n\n\n5\nValue suppressed because it does not meet US Census Bureau publication standards.\n\n\n6\nValue calculated from other released measures - no significant distortion\n\n\n7\nValue calculated from other released measures - some of which have significantly distorted data\n\n\n9\nData significantly distorted - fuzzed value released\n\n\n10\nAggregate of cells - no significant distortion\n\n\n11\nAggregate of cells not released because component cells do not meet U.S. Census Bureau publication standards\n\n\n12\nAggregate of cells - some of which have significantly distorted data\n\n\n\nLooking at this table, we see that there are 5 status codes that should correspond to missing values: -1, -2, 3, 5, 11. When analyzing the dataset, we see that there is indeed a one-to-one correspondance between a missing value in a data column and the presence of one of these codes in the corresponding status column. This means that a value is missing if and only if this is indicated in the status column, where this column gives us more information about the reason that the value is missing.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nviolations &lt;- pseoe |&gt;\n  rowwise() |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    failed_check = any(\n      map2_lgl(\n        variablecols, \n        statuscols, \n        ~ is.na(get(.x)) & (get(.y) %in% c(1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12))\n      )\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(failed_check) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n# assertion\nstopifnot(nrow(violations) == 0)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nviolations &lt;- pseoe |&gt;\n  rowwise() |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    failed_check = any(\n      map2_lgl(\n        variablecols, \n        statuscols, \n        ~ !is.na(get(.x)) & (get(.y) %in% c(-1, -2, 3, 5, 11))\n      )\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(failed_check) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n# assertion\nstopifnot(nrow(violations) == 0)\n\n\nTo get a sense of the reason for missing values, we can thus look at the distribution of status codes in each of the status columns, where we only consider status codes corresponding to missing values. This is shown in the following plot.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nstatus_descriptions &lt;- c(\n  `-2` = \"No data available for this quarter\",\n  `-1` = \"Data not available\",\n  `1` = \"OK\",\n  `2` = \"IPEDS counts edited for consistency with PSEO categories\",\n  `3` = \"Counts not available\",\n  `4` = \"IPEDS counts partially missing\",\n  `5` = \"Census standards\",\n  `6` = \"Value calculated - no distortion\",\n  `7` = \"Value calculated - some distortion\",\n  `9` = \"Data significantly distorted - fuzzed value released\",\n  `10` = \"Aggregate - no distortion\",\n  `11` = \"Aggregate not released (standards unmet)\",\n  `12` = \"Aggregate - some distortion\"\n)\n\nfacet_order &lt;- c(\n  \"status_y1_earnings\", \"status_y1_employed_count\", \"status_y1_total_count\",\n  \"status_y5_earnings\", \"status_y5_employed_count\", \"status_y5_total_count\",\n  \"status_y10_earnings\", \"status_y10_employed_count\", \"status_y10_total_count\"\n)\n\nplot_data &lt;- pseoe |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = all_of(statuscols), \n    names_to = \"status_variable\",\n    values_to = \"status_value\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(!(status_value %in% c(1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12))) # Exclude rows that have valid value\n\nplot_data &lt;- plot_data |&gt;\n  mutate(status_variable = str_replace_all(status_variable, c(\n      \"grads_earn\" = \"employed_count\",\n      \"ipeds_count\" = \"total_count\"\n      )),\n      status_description = status_descriptions[as.character(status_value)],\n      status_variable = factor(status_variable, levels=facet_order))\n\nplot_data &lt;- plot_data |&gt;\n  group_by(status_variable, status_description) |&gt;\n  summarise(count = n(), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  group_by(status_variable) |&gt;\n  mutate(percentage = count / sum(count))\n\nggplot(plot_data, aes(x = status_description, y = percentage)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"steelblue\", color = \"white\") +\n  facet_wrap(~status_variable) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Reason for missing value\",\n    x = \"Reason\",\n    y = \"Percentage\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen looking at the earnings data and the number of employed graduates, we see that this data for graduates one year after graduation is only missing because they don’t meet the Census Bureau standards.\nHowever, when looking at graduates five years after graduation, this data is also often missing because it is simply not yet available. This trend continues for graduates ten years after graduation, where the most common reason for missing data is the fact that it is simply not available.\nThis of course makes sense, as many of the rows in the dataset correspond to cohorts that graduated less than 5 or 10 years ago. However, all cohorts graduated at least one year ago, and thus the reason for missing values one year after graduation cannot be that it is not yet available. Lastly, we see that the “total count” columns, representing the total number of graduates in the cohort, are only missing due to unavailability.",

While the intuition that higher degrees yield higher income holds true in general, there are notable exceptions.\nFields related to science and technology consistently dominate top-earning outcomes across all degree levels. This likely reflects the consistent demand and high value placed on general analytical skills that we often see in the labor market. However, healthcare professionals appear to significantly increase their earning potential with advanced degrees, while engineering fields tend to show steady earning growth across all degree levels.\nAlso, certain fields stand out for disproportionately high earnings at advanced degree levels. For example, graduates with Health Profession Master’s degrees often earn more in Year 1 than most Doctoral - Research graduates make even 10 years post-graduation. This might reflect the immediate applicability and demand for healthcare expertise, like possibly nursing.\nSo, in general, prospective students can consider that STEM fields lead to top-earning salaries with appreciable growth.",

For state-level analysis, it is important to note that there is no distinction on where the student was employed - that is to say that a Maine graduate could have been employed in South Carolina, but is still counted for Maine, for example. Also, due to regional cover gaps pointed out in the data section, we don’t have data for each state. Due to incomplete coverage on the state level as well, we also have to point out that the calculated outcomes might be not fully representative because of a possible bias towards top or lower-ranking institutions.\nThe plot does show significant variation in income levels between states, highlighting disparities in educational quality, job opportunities or possibly the dominant or prevalent industries in each state. States with hubs for higher paying industries like manufacturing, finance, or technology, such as Texas or Pennsylvania, tend to have higher earnings while rural or agricultural states, such as Oklahoma or Utah, remain lower.\nAlso, notably, a large population state with tech and financial sector hubs like New York shows a relatively low average median income in Year 1 but a significantly higher value by Year 10. This may reflect the variability and range of salaries in the state, driven by its diverse opportunities and the large population accessing them.\nWe can also observe the effects of the sampling bias in our data. Michigan tops the list with high earning outcomes, but this can be explained by the fact that the University of Michigan, a top-ranked public university, is the only institution in the dataset for this state. (PSEOE Data Coverage).\nOverall, what this means for prospective students is that where they go to school can be a general indicator for their starting salaries and career progression. In general, they should weigh the quality of the school’s education against the opportunities local to that school, as taking such opportunities may impact their long term career trajectory.",

If that’s the case, we would expect to see a positive correlation between Year 1 earnings outcomes and the number of students pursuing those higher paying degree types.\n\n\nCode\nplot_df &lt;- pseoe |&gt;\n  group_by(degree_level, degree_label) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    avg_median_y1_earnings = mean(y1_p50_earnings, na.rm = TRUE),\n    total_employment = sum(y1_grads_earn, na.rm = TRUE),\n    .groups = \"drop\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(\n    !is.na(avg_median_y1_earnings),\n    total_employment &gt; 0\n  ) |&gt;\n  arrange(degree_level)\n\nsuppressWarnings(\n  ggplot(plot_df, aes(y = total_employment, x = avg_median_y1_earnings)) +\n    suppressWarnings(geom_point(size = 4, color = \"red\")) +\n    suppressWarnings(geom_smooth(method = \"lm\",se = FALSE,color = \"blue\",linetype = \"dashed\")) +\n    geom_label_repel(aes(label = degree_label), \n                     size = 4, \n                     max.overlaps = Inf, \n                     box.padding = 0.5, \n                     point.padding = 0.5, \n                     segment.color = \"grey50\") +\n    theme_minimal(base_size = 14) +\n    scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_number(big.mark = \",\", decimal.mark = \".\")) +\n    scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::label_number(big.mark = \",\", decimal.mark = \".\")) +\n    labs(\n      title = \"Total Graduation Counts vs. Average Median Earnings by Degree Type (Year 1)\",\n      y = \"Total Graduation Count\",\n      x = \"Average Median Earnings (2021 US Dollars)\"\n    ) +\n    theme(\n      axis.text.x = element_text(size = 12),\n      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 12),\n      axis.title.x = element_text(size = 14, margin = margin(t = 10)),\n      axis.title.y = element_text(size = 14, margin = margin(r = 10)),\n      plot.margin = margin(t = 20, r = 10, b = 20, l = 20)\n    )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows Year 1 average median earnings against total graduation counts, with the dashed blue line corresponding to the regression line. While one might assume that higher degree levels - and their associated higher income - would attract more graduates, the data shows a rather negative correlation. High-paying degrees like Doctoral - Prof. and Doctoral - Research have relatively low graduation counts, while degrees like Baccalaureate and Associates have much higher counts despite lower incomes.\nCertificate programs (&lt;1 year and 1-2 years) cluster at the low end for both earnings and employment, reinforcing their role as niche credentials, potentially for those who are looking to switch careers. Post-Bacc Certificates have low graduation counts but show higher average median earnings than Masters, also possibly due to its specialized nature leading to demand in highly specific niches. Masters degrees seem to balance moderate incomes and employment by occupying the middle ground.\nFurthermore, the seemingly negative correlation between median earnings and graduation count can also be explained by how the more advanced the degree is, the harder it is to obtain. This leads to fewer graduates, while the skills obtained in these degrees increases accessibility to high paying jobs, leading to higher median earnings.\nOverall, this plot clearly suggests that factors beyond immediate income, such as accessibility, cost, and career pathways, may heavily influence degree level choices. The job market does not require highly advanced degrees for most positions, so it could be an economical choice for most to pursue employment over continuing education at a cost, despite having better long term earnings potential than a standard Baccalaureate degree.",

In contrast, more general degrees like Associates and Baccalaureate degrees show noticeable gaps, indicating that a significant portion of graduates remain unemployed. Notably though, Baccalaureate degrees have the largest gap of these three. One reason for this could be that a significant portion of graduates of Baccaluareate degrees often opt to still pursue a Masters immediately after graduation, which would be counted as unemployed in our analysis.\nHowever, the overall discrepancy for the general degrees when compared to the specialized degrees could be due to the broader applicability and generality of these degrees, which may lead to greater variability in employment outcomes. Additionally, the larger graduate populations for these degrees might create more competition in the job market, further contributing to the gaps. The relatively small graduate numbers in niche fields may align better with job market demand, which would result in the higher observed employment rates.\nA common example familiar to us is those with Baccalaureate degrees trying to break into the Data Science industry having a harder time than those with a Masters degree. So, prospective students should consider the competition they may face and the demand for their degree when choosing a degree level.",

We see that for all degree types, almost all cohorts have higher median earnings ten years after graduation. However, the range of magnitudes of this difference seems to depend strongly on the type of degree. The strongest growth potential seems to occur for cohorts in a professional doctoral program, where the median earnings 10 years after graduation can grow up to almost $400,000 from around $60,000 one year after graduation. Furthermore, Bachelors programs also allow for significant growth potential, where earnings ten years after graduation often seem to be $100,000 higher than one year after graduation.\nResearch doctoral and Masters programs seem to have smaller increases in earnings one to ten years after graduation than Bachelors programs, but graduates from these programs do however start with higher earnings one year after graduation. The different types of certificates and associates degrees also seem to have some growth potential, with associates degrees showing increases in earnings of up to around $80,000.",

For higher earning field such as Computer and Engineering however, the gap seems to have slightly widened.\nThese graphs seems to indicate that a Masters degree is indeed worth it, especially for higher earning fields. However, this analysis does not take into account the cost of a Masters degree, both from a financial perspective and a time perspective. Completing a Masters degree requires a significant financial investment and the devoted time can also be used to gain work experience and progress your career, which might perhaps lead to higher earnings. Furthermore, this analysis also does not take into account at which stage in their career graduates are. Masters students often already have several years of work experience before starting the program, which might automatically lead to higher earnings after completing the program.",

These distributions are shown for the top 20 most popular degrees in the dataset. We see that the shape of the distribution varies strongly depending on the specific degree. For example, for a Masters in Business and management or a Bachelors in Health Professions, the distribution is widely spread. This indicates that for these degrees, the institution does matter significantly, as different institutions correspond to strongly differing median earnings.\nHowever, for other degrees such as a Bachelors in English Language or Psychology, and to a smaller extent a Bachelors in Engineering, the distribution is much more tightly spread. Therefore for these degrees, the awarding institution seems to have a smaller impact on earnings outcomes.\nIn general, the graph also seems to exhibit a trend where higher earning degrees tend to have a more widely spread distribution.\n\n\nCode\n# Calculate median earnings for ordering\npseoe_ridgeline_data &lt;- pseoe |&gt;\n  filter(cipcode != \"00\") |&gt;\n  filter(status_y1_earnings %in% c(1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12)) |&gt;\n  filter(status_y1_ipeds_count %in% c(1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12)) |&gt;\n  mutate(cipcode_degree_label = paste(degree_label, cipcode_label, sep = \" - \")) |&gt;\n  filter(cipcode_degree_label %in% pseoe_popular_degrees$cipcode_degree_label) |&gt;\n  group_by(cipcode_degree_label, institution) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg_y1_p75_earnings = mean(y1_p75_earnings, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  group_by(cipcode_degree_label) |&gt;\n  mutate(median_earnings = median(avg_y1_p75_earnings, na.rm = TRUE)) |&gt;\n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(median_earnings)) |&gt;\n  mutate(cipcode_degree_label = factor(cipcode_degree_label, levels = rev(unique(cipcode_degree_label))))\n\n\n# Ridgeline plot\nsuppressMessages(suppressWarnings(ggplot(pseoe_ridgeline_data, aes(x = avg_y1_p75_earnings, y = cipcode_degree_label)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(alpha = 0.8, scale = 1.5, fill = \"cornflowerblue\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_number(big.mark = \",\", decimal.mark = \".\"),\n                     limits = c(0, 150000)) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Year 1 75th Percentile Earnings (2021 US Dollars)\",\n    y = \"Degree Level & Field\",\n    title = \"Distribution of Year 1 75th Percentile Earnings over Institutions,\\n by Degree Level & Field\",\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size=14) +\n  theme(\n      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),\n      axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10)),\n      axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r = 10)),\n      plot.margin = margin(t = 20, r = 10, b = 20, l = 20),\n      legend.position = \"top\", legend.direction = \"horizontal\",\n      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)\n    )))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis ridgeline plot then shows the distribution of the 75th percentile of earnings one year after graduation over different institutions. We see similar trends as in the previous graph, where the same degrees as before seem to have the most widely spread distributions. However, in general we observe that for each degree the 75th percentile earnings are more widely spread than the median earnings. This indicates that the awarding institution seems to be more important when considering the possibility for high earnings outcomes.",

    "text": "3.9 How have career prospects changed over time?\nThe job market is ever-changing. Degrees in fields that led to high paying jobs twenty years ago might not do so presently, while other degrees might have seen a big increase in earnings. In this section, we look at how average median earnings for different degrees have changed from 2001 to 2016, which correspond to the earliest and most recent graduation cohorts in the dataset.\nIn an attempt to eliminate any bias that is present in the dataset due to incomplete reporting, we performed matching of cohorts from 2001 to cohorts of 2016. Specifically, for each cohort that graduated in 2001 from a certain institution with a certain degree, there is exactly one cohort that graduated from the same institution with the same degree in 2016, and vice-versa. This makes sure that when we are comparing earnings outcomes for a certain degree in 2001 versus 2016, we are doing so for the same institutions awarding the degree.\n\n\nCode\nidcols_inst &lt;- c(\n  \"agg_level_pseo\", \"inst_level\", \"institution\", \"degree_level\",\n  \"cip_level\", \"cipcode\" \n)\n\npseoe_01and16 &lt;- pseoe |&gt; \n                      filter(grad_cohort == \"2001\" | grad_cohort == \"2016\") |&gt;\n                      filter(status_y1_earnings %in% c(1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12)) |&gt;\n                      group_by(across(all_of(idcols_inst))) |&gt;\n                      filter(all(c(\"2001\", \"2016\") %in% grad_cohort))\n\n# assertion\nnum_cohorts_check &lt;- pseoe_01and16 |&gt;\n  summarize(num_cohorts = n_distinct(grad_cohort), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  summarize(all_two = all(num_cohorts == 2))\n\nstopifnot(num_cohorts_check$all_two)\n\npseoe_cipcode_change01to16 &lt;- pseoe_01and16 |&gt;\n                              ungroup() |&gt;\n                              group_by(cipcode_label, degree_label, grad_cohort) |&gt;\n                              summarise(mean_med_earning = mean(y1_p50_earnings, na.rm = TRUE), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n                              ungroup() |&gt;\n                              pivot_wider(names_from = grad_cohort, values_from = mean_med_earning, \n                                          names_prefix =\"earnings_\") |&gt; \n                              mutate(change_med_earning = earnings_2016 - earnings_2001)\n\npseoe_cipcode_change01to16 &lt;- pseoe_cipcode_change01to16 |&gt;\n  arrange(change_med_earning) |&gt;\n  select(cipcode_label, degree_label, change_med_earning) |&gt;\n  mutate(cipcode_degree_label = paste( degree_label, cipcode_label, sep = \" - \"))\n\n\nggplot(tail(pseoe_cipcode_change01to16, 15), aes(y = factor(cipcode_degree_label,\n                                                                   levels = cipcode_degree_label[order(change_med_earning)]),\n                                                        x = change_med_earning)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"cornflowerblue\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::label_number(big.mark = \",\", decimal.mark = \".\")) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"Change in Average Year 1 Median Earnings,\\n (2021 US Dollars)\",\n    y = \"Degree Level & Field\",\n    title = \"Degrees with Largest Increase in Average Year 1 Median Earnings,\\n (2001 to 2016)\",\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal(base_size=14) +\n  theme(\n      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 10),\n      axis.title.x = element_text(margin = margin(t = 10)),\n      axis.title.y = element_text(margin = margin(r = 10)),\n      plot.margin = margin(t = 20, r = 10, b = 20, l = 20),\n      legend.position = \"top\", legend.direction = \"horizontal\",\n      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)\n    )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis plot shows the 15 degrees with the highest increase in average median earnings one year after graduation from 2001 to 2016.

We see that only 2 degree levels - a professional doctorate and a one to two year certificate - have seen a small increase in median earnings of less then $500. A Masters degree and a two to four year certificate have seen the biggest decreases of around $1000 and $5,500 respectively. Note also that due to the matching process, the earnings decrease for Masters programs for example, cannot be caused by the addition of new types of Masters programs that are not attractive in the job market. The decrease is only calculated for Masters for which cohorts graduated in both 2001 and 2016.",

    "text": "Now that we’ve examined how factors like location, institution, field of study, degree level, and time influence employment outcomes, another key question has emerged - what are the most popular fields of study over time? Understanding these trends can provide valuable context for how student interests and societal demands have shifted. This can offer insights into how higher education continues to adapt to an evolving job market and world.\n\nTrends in Popular Fields of Study: Graduation Counts Over Time\n\n\n\n\n\nBackward Pause Forward\n\n\n\n\n\nThis interactive graph shows trends in the most popular fields of study based on graduation counts over time at a national level. The pause button can be clicked to pause the visualization at any displayed year. The left and right buttons will move you backward and forwards through the animation respectively. Please note that you may have to maximize your browser window to view the entire visualization.\nWe see more variation in the popular degrees than we would intuitively expect. This may be due to the fact that the dataset does not have complete coverage of all graduates, which might lead to sampling bias as pointed out in the data section. Still, these trends reflect a portion of the workforce and societal demands during different periods. For example, Healthcare fields show consistency, likely due to a steady demand for medical professionals, as seen in our previous analyses as well, since healthcare is always needed. The Liberal Arts/Sciences field is consistently present in the top 20, possibly because of its broad appeal and flexibility for students who are undecided about a specific career path. The same holds for Business related fields, highlighting their alignment with job market demands and strong career outcomes, also as we’ve seen in our previous analyses. Interestingly, technology-related fields like Computer and Information Sciences show significant variation, frequently entering and leaving the top 20. This could be because the positive perceptions of the information industry did not have its massive increase until the mid 2010s. If our data extended into more recent years, we would likely see these fields ranking much higher. Also, popular and relatively new majors, like Data Science, may not have made the top 20 because these programs did not exist yet.\nOverall, prospective students should examine trends in their desired fields of study to assess job security and consistency, which have been key themes of this project. At the same time, students are encouraged to explore emerging trends touched upon in the analysis, as these can reveal opportunities in rapidly growing industries. By doing so, students can make more informed decisions about their education to position themselves for success.",

    "text": "Through this project, we have explored several key questions leading to insights into post-secondary employment outcomes. STEM fields and advanced degrees generally offer the highest earning potential and growth over time, though there are exceptions, particularly in professional degrees. Healthcare and business degrees remain consistently popular and lucrative, while technology fields stand out for their strong growth potential. State-level disparities in earnings highlight the impact of local job markets and industry presence on post-graduation income. For certain fields, the awarding institution plays a significant role in shaping outcomes, highlighting the importance of education quality and institutional reputation, especially in higher income and more popular fields. Furthermore, degree level does seem to have a significant impact on earnings and growth potential, making a Masters worth it. Lastly, certain degrees have seen significant changes in earnings outcomes over the past two decades, highlighting the importance of keeping up with the current trends in the job market when making decisions about your education and career.\nHowever, these findings are shaped by the limitations of the dataset. Incomplete state-level coverage and missing Year 5 and Year 10 data for more recent cohorts restrict the scope of time-based analyses. Additionally, our analysis simplifies a complex decision-making process - choosing a degree, major, or institution - by focusing on income and employment metrics, while numerous factors specific to an individual remain unaccounted for. Despite these constraints, through aggregation by field and degree level, we ensure that our insights can still provide a valuable baseline for prospective students, helping them make more informed decisions about their education.\nFuture work could build on this foundation by incorporating demographic data to examine outcomes by socioeconomic status, gender, and race. This would offer a more nuanced understanding of the observed disparities. Also, leveraging additional datasets from additional authoritative and governmental sources could enhance the robustness of the analysis, while expanding employment metrics to include less quantifiable values like employee satisfaction and fulfillment could further refine the guidance for students. Overall, this project has demonstrated the importance of nuanced data interpretation for clear and helpful insights for students, all while navigating the challenges of incomplete data.",
