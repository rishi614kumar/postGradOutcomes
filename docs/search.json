    "text": "1 Introduction\nChoosing a college, deciding on a major, and pursuing graduate studies are pivotal decisions that significantly shape an individual’s career trajectory and financial future. These choices determine career opportunities and influence long-term earnings potential and overall personal fulfillment. While personal interests and intellectual growth are equally valid reasons for pursuing higher education, this project focuses on understanding how these decisions translate into measurable post-graduation outcomes, specifically earnings and employment rates.\nWith over 60% of Americans having attended college and enrollment numbers increasing annually, the relevance of exploring post-secondary employment outcomes continues to grow (Census, NCES). Analyzing this data provides valuable insights that can help prospective students evaluate fields of study and degree levels in alignment with their career aspirations and financial goals. This analysis aims to support informed decision-making for students and families by focusing on the measurable outcomes available to us through data.\nFor the reasons above, we have focused on this Post-Secondary Employment Outcomes topic. This project will explore the following general questions:\n\nHow do earnings differ by field of study and degree type?\nWhat are the trends in earnings growth from Year 1 to Year 5 post-graduation? Year 5 to Year 10?\nWhich fields or degrees lead to the highest employment rates after graduation?\nHow do employment outcomes vary by institution?\nWhat is the earnings gap between the 25th and 75th percentiles across fields or degrees?\nAre graduates in specific fields or institutions more likely to stay in lower or higher earning brackets?\nHow have career prospects changed over the past decade?\n\n\n1.0.1 References\n\nCensus Bureau, Educational Attainment\nNational Center for Education Statistics, Educational Attainment (NCES)",

    "text": "2.1.1 Data Source\nThe national and state-level PSEO datasets are publicly available through the United States Center for Economic Studies. Specifically, we are using the PSEOE (earnings) and PSEOF (employment rates) files from the PSEO section.\n\n\n2.1.2 Data Collection\nThe data is collected through the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program. This program partners with various post-secondary institutions, state agencies, and the United States Census Bureau. LEHD merges admistrative job data with the post-secondary education records from its partners to create the PSEO datasets.\n\n\n2.1.3 Data Format\nWe are working with CSV files downloaded directly from the public data access page. The national-level datasets contains approximately 564,000 records and 36 columns, covering aggregated earnings and employment outcomes for graduates 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years post-graduation (when available). The main identifiers in the dataset include:\n\nInstitution\n\nDegree Level\n\nDegree Field\n\nCohort Graduation Year\n\n\n2.1.3.1 Mappings for Identifiers:\nPlease note that we enrich this data for visualization and analysis by mapping ID values to string values using external sources.\n\nInstitution (OPEID): Post-Secondary Institutions with OPEID\n\nDegree Field (CIPCODE): CIP Code Table\n\nDegree Level: NCES Degree Level Classifcations | PSEO Technical Documentation\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Data Coverage\nThe data covers the years from 2001 to 2020 as of the 2023Q20 release. New data for additional partner institutions is added irregularly, such as the June 2024 update that incorporated new universities. See the PSEO data notices for their updates.\nLimitations: There are regional coverage gaps in the dataset because it only includes outcomes from institutions that have partnered with the Census Bureau through the data-sharing agreements. For that reason, many states have no coverage while most others only have partial coverage. Breakdown of state-by-state coverage can be found here.\n\n\n2.1.5 Data References/Documentation\nFor more details on the above, see the follow resources:\n\n2.1.5.1 PSEO Data:\n\nPSEO Data (Data Download & Coverage Stats)\nPSEO Documentation (High Level Summary)\nPSEO Technical Documentation (Technical Details, Data Collection, Rationale)\nPSEO Schema (4.25, 4.36, 4.37)\nPSEO Data Notices\n\n\n\n2.1.5.2 Mapping Data\n\nPost-Secondary Institutions with OPEID\nCIP Code Table\nNCES Degree Level Classifcations",
