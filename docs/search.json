    "text": "1 Introduction\nChoosing a college, deciding on a major, and pursuing graduate studies are pivotal decisions that significantly shape an individual’s career trajectory and financial future. These choices determine career opportunities and influence long-term earnings potential and overall personal fulfillment. While personal interests and intellectual growth are equally valid reasons for pursuing higher education, this project focuses on understanding how these decisions translate into measurable post-graduation outcomes, specifically earnings and employment rates.\nWith over 60% of Americans having attended college and enrollment numbers increasing annually, the relevance of exploring post-secondary employment outcomes continues to grow. Analyzing this data provides valuable insights that can help prospective students evaluate fields of study and degree levels in alignment with their career aspirations and financial goals. This analysis aims to support informed decision-making for students and families by focusing on the measurable outcomes available to us through data.\nFor the reasons above, we have focused on this Post-Secondary Employment Outcomes topic. This project will explore the following general questions:",

    "text": "2.1.1 Data Source\nWe have identified the national and state-level PSEO datasets from the United States Center for Economic Studies. These data sets are publicly available here.\n\n\n2.1.2 Data Collection\nThe data is collected through the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program. This program partners with various post-secondary institutions, state agencies, and the United States Census Bureau. LEHD merges its admistrative job data with the post-secondary education records from its partners to create the PSEO datasets.\nFurther details can be found here:\n\nhttps://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/pseo_documentation.html\nhttps://lehd.ces.census.gov/data/pseo_experimental.html\nhttps://lehd.ces.census.gov/doc/PSEOTechnicalDocumentation.pdf\n\n\n\n2.1.3 Data Format\nWe consume the data as a csv file, downloaded directly from their publicly accessible data download page. The national-level report alone contains approximately 564,000 records with 36 columns. These records cover the aggregated earnings and employment outcomes for graduates 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years after graduation (when available) based on the following identifiers:\n\nInstitution\nDegree Level\nDegree Field\nCohort’s Graduation Year\n\nInstitution ID Mappings (OPEID):\n\nhttps://collegefutures.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/post-secondary-institutions-with-unitid.xlsx\n\nDegree Field Mappings (CIPCODE):\n\nhttps://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/cipcode/browse.aspx?y=55\n\nDegree Level Mappings:\n\nhttps://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/report-your-data/data-tip-sheet-reporting-graduate-awards\nhttps://lehd.ces.census.gov/doc/PSEOTechnicalDocumentation.pdf\n\nThe data covers the years from 2001 to 2020 as of the 2023Q20 release. New data for additional partner institutions is added irregularly, such as the June 2024 update that incorporated new universities. See the PSEO data notices for their updates.\n\n\n2.1.4 Data Limitations\nThere are coverage gaps in the dataset because it only includes outcomes from instutitions that have partnered with the Census Bureau through the data-sharing agreements. For that reason, many states have no coverage while most others only have partial coverage. Breakdown of state-by-state coverage can be found here.",
