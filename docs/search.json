    "text": "1 Introduction\nChoosing a college, deciding on a major, and pursuing graduate studies are pivotal decisions that significantly shape an individual’s career trajectory and financial future. These choices determine career opportunities and influence long-term earnings potential and overall personal fulfillment. While personal interests and intellectual growth are equally valid reasons for pursuing higher education, this project focuses on understanding how these decisions translate into measurable post-graduation outcomes, specifically earnings and employment rates.\nWith over 60% of Americans having attended college and enrollment numbers increasing annually, the relevance of exploring post-secondary employment outcomes continues to grow (Census, NCES). Analyzing this data provides valuable insights that can help prospective students evaluate fields of study and degree levels in alignment with their career aspirations and financial goals. This analysis aims to support informed decision-making for students and families by focusing on the measurable outcomes available to us through data.\nFor the reasons above, we have focused on this Post-Secondary Employment Outcomes topic. This project will explore the following general questions:\n\nHow do earnings differ by field of study and degree type?\nWhat are the trends in earnings growth from Year 1 to Year 5 post-graduation? Year 5 to Year 10?\nWhich fields or degrees lead to the highest employment rates after graduation?\nHow do employment outcomes vary by institution?\nWhat is the earnings gap between the 25th and 75th percentiles across fields or degrees?\nAre graduates in specific fields or institutions more likely to stay in lower or higher earning brackets?\nHow have career prospects changed over the past decade?\n\n\n1.0.1 References\n\nCensus Bureau, Educational Attainment\nNational Center for Education Statistics, Educational Attainment (NCES)",

    "text": "2.1.1 Data Source\nThe national and state-level PSEO datasets are publicly available through the United States Center for Economic Studies. Specifically, we are using the PSEOE files (contains salary and employment statistics) from the PSEO section.\n\n\n2.1.2 Data Collection\nThe data is collected through the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) program. This program partners with various post-secondary institutions, state agencies, and the United States Census Bureau. LEHD merges admistrative job data with the post-secondary education records from its partners to create the PSEO datasets.\n\n\n2.1.3 Data Format\nWe are working with CSV files downloaded directly from the public data access page. The national-level datasets contains approximately 564,000 records and 36 columns, covering aggregated earnings and employment outcomes for graduates 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years post-graduation (when available).\nNote that there are three types of columns in the PSEO datasets:\n\nID: unique identifiers for each group\nData: provides earning and employment information about the given group.\n\nAll outcomes are recorded 1 year, 5 years, and 10 years post-graduation when applicable\nEarning outcomes are provided through the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, in 2021 dollars\n\nStatus: provides information about the “quality” of an observation in its respective data column\n\nThe main identifiers in the dataset that we will use in our analysis includes:\n\nInstitution\nDegree Level\nDegree Field\nCohort Graduation Year\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Data Coverage\nThe data covers the years from 2001 to 2020 as of the 2023Q20 release. New data for additional partner institutions is added irregularly, such as the June 2024 update that incorporated new universities. See the PSEO data notices for their updates.\nLimitations: There are regional coverage gaps in the dataset because it only includes outcomes from institutions that have partnered with the Census Bureau through data-sharing agreements. For that reason, many states have no coverage while most others only have partial coverage. Breakdown of state-by-state coverage can be found on this webpage.\n\n\n2.1.5 Data References/Documentation\nFor more details on the above, see the follow resources:\n\nPSEO Data (Data Download & Coverage Stats)\nPSEO Documentation (High Level Summary)\nPSEO Technical Documentation (Technical Details, Data Collection, Rationale)\nPSEO Schema (4.25, 4.36, 4.37)\nPSEO Data Notices",

The year 5 earnings columns are missing about 60 percent of the time, and the year 1 earnings columns about 50%. When looking at the missing patterns, we also see that the earnings columns for a given year are always missing together, i.e. if one percentile is missing the others are also missing. Furthermore, the columns ending with “_emp”, indicating the amount of employed graduates for the given year, is also always missing together with the corresponding earnings columns. Lastly, the columns ending in “_tot”, indicating the total amount of graduates for which the earnings percentiles are calculated for the given group and year, are always missing less often than the corresponding earnings columns.\nThe next thing that we can take into account is that the dataset gives us information about the data present in the data columns through the status columns. Concretely, the status columns contain one of the values shown in the following table (from the LEHD data schema):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatus code\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n-2\nNo data available in this category for this quarter\n\n\n-1\nData not available to compute this estimate\n\n\n1\nOK\n\n\n2\nIPEDS counts edited for consistency with PSEO categories\n\n\n3\nIPEDS counts not available\n\n\n4\nIPEDS counts partially missing\n\n\n5\nValue suppressed because it does not meet US Census Bureau publication standards.\n\n\n6\nValue calculated from other released measures - no significant distortion\n\n\n7\nValue calculated from other released measures - some of which have significantly distorted data\n\n\n9\nData significantly distorted - fuzzed value released\n\n\n10\nAggregate of cells - no significant distortion\n\n\n11\nAggregate of cells not released because component cells do not meet U.S. Census Bureau publication standards\n\n\n12\nAggregate of cells - some of which have significantly distorted data\n\n\n\nLooking at this table, we see that there are 5 status codes that should correspond to missing values: -1, -2, 3, 5, 11. When analyzing the dataset, we see that there is indeed a one-to-one correspondance between a missing value in a data column and the presence of one of these codes in the corresponding status column. This means that a value is missing if and only if this is indicated in the status column, where this column gives us more information about the reason that the value is missing.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nviolations &lt;- pseoe |&gt;\n  rowwise() |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    failed_check = any(\n      map2_lgl(\n        variablecols, \n        statuscols, \n        ~ is.na(get(.x)) & (get(.y) %in% c(1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12))\n      )\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(failed_check) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n# assertion\nstopifnot(nrow(violations) == 0)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(purrr)\n\nviolations &lt;- pseoe |&gt;\n  rowwise() |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    failed_check = any(\n      map2_lgl(\n        variablecols, \n        statuscols, \n        ~ !is.na(get(.x)) & (get(.y) %in% c(-1, -2, 3, 5, 11))\n      )\n    )\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(failed_check) |&gt;\n  ungroup()\n\n# assertion\nstopifnot(nrow(violations) == 0)\n\n\nTo get a sense of the reason for missing values, we can thus look at the distribution of status codes in each of the status columns, where we only consider status codes corresponding to missing values. This is shown in the following plot.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(stringr)\n\nstatus_descriptions &lt;- c(\n  `-2` = \"No data available for this quarter\",\n  `-1` = \"Data not available\",\n  `1` = \"OK\",\n  `2` = \"IPEDS counts edited for consistency with PSEO categories\",\n  `3` = \"Counts not available\",\n  `4` = \"IPEDS counts partially missing\",\n  `5` = \"Census standards\",\n  `6` = \"Value calculated - no distortion\",\n  `7` = \"Value calculated - some distortion\",\n  `9` = \"Data significantly distorted - fuzzed value released\",\n  `10` = \"Aggregate - no distortion\",\n  `11` = \"Aggregate not released (standards unmet)\",\n  `12` = \"Aggregate - some distortion\"\n)\n\nfacet_order &lt;- c(\n  \"status_y1_earnings\", \"status_y1_employed_count\", \"status_y1_total_count\",\n  \"status_y5_earnings\", \"status_y5_employed_count\", \"status_y5_total_count\",\n  \"status_y10_earnings\", \"status_y10_employed_count\", \"status_y10_total_count\"\n)\n\nplot_data &lt;- pseoe |&gt;\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = all_of(statuscols), \n    names_to = \"status_variable\",\n    values_to = \"status_value\"\n  ) |&gt;\n  filter(!(status_value %in% c(1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12))) # Exclude rows that have valid value\n\nplot_data &lt;- plot_data |&gt;\n  mutate(status_variable = str_replace_all(status_variable, c(\n      \"grads_earn\" = \"employed_count\",\n      \"ipeds_count\" = \"total_count\"\n      )),\n      status_description = status_descriptions[as.character(status_value)],\n      status_variable = factor(status_variable, levels=facet_order))\n\nplot_data &lt;- plot_data |&gt;\n  group_by(status_variable, status_description) |&gt;\n  summarise(count = n(), .groups = \"drop\") |&gt;\n  group_by(status_variable) |&gt;\n  mutate(percentage = count / sum(count))\n\nggplot(plot_data, aes(x = status_description, y = percentage)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"steelblue\", color = \"white\") +\n  facet_wrap(~status_variable) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Reason for missing value\",\n    x = \"Reason\",\n    y = \"Percentage\"\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen looking at the earnings data and the number of employed graduates, we see that this data for graduates one year after graduation is only missing because they don’t meet the Census Bureau standards.\nHowever, when looking at graduates five years after graduation, this data is also often missing because it is simply not yet available. This trend continues for graduates ten years after graduation, where the most common reason for missing data is the fact that it is simply not available.\nThis of course makes sense, as many of the rows in the dataset correspond to cohorts that graduated less than 5 or 10 years ago. However, all cohorts graduated at least one year ago, and thus the reason for missing values one year after graduation cannot be that it is not yet available. Lastly, we see that the “total count” columns, representing the total number of graduates in the cohort, are only missing due to unavailability.",
